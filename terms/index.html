  <p>Plain-English terms for subscribers and visitors.</p>

  <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>Annual plan charged upfront via Stripe. During the pilot, access is activated manually by assigning a “subscriber” role to your account.</p>

  <h2>Refunds & cancellations</h2>
  <p>You can cancel anytime to stop renewal. Refunds are at our discretion unless required by Australian consumer law.</p>

  <h2>Availability</h2>
  <p>We aim for high availability but the service is provided “as is”. We may update or replace resources over time.</p>

  <h2>Liability</h2>
  <p>No advice here is a substitute for independent professional advice. To the maximum extent permitted by law, our liability is limited to the amount you paid for the current term.</p>
